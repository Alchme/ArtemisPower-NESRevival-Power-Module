Launched in 1972, the 7805 and other 78 series LDOâ€™s have proven their reliability and worth over the last 50 years.  
Using a Linear Regulator will have more heat but will also have far less Noise than a switching regulator.  
The 7805 IC Heatsink from your original NES Power Module will fit perfectly on our LDO boards
This orignal Heatsink will provide enough cooling for 1.5 amps of power on the L7805CV

If you  no longer have the original 7805 heatsink or you are building an Optendo, there isn't an aftermarket Heatsink that we recommend. <br>
Searching for one either has one that is far too light weight to provide adequte cooling or is just too large for the location on the board. <br>
In this case, we recommend a high quality Drop In Switching Regulator Replacement.  Below are the 2 that we recommend. <br>
