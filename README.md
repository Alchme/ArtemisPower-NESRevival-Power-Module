# NESRevival - Power Module for Repairs and DIY Consoles

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alchme/AtremisPower-NESRevival-Power-Module/main/ReadmeSources/NewestBanner1.png)

The latest repository for the Repair Modules for the NESRevival Project. Preserved and Inhereted to Alchme/Guardians_Projects from Merlin Shaw. Who was our Original Developer. <br>
Completely Redesigning the NES Power Module to Reduce Noise and EMI. Overall improving the design for the future foward~! <br>

Project Guardian is a Design Partner, and has these available for sell.  <br> https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_ssn=The.modder <br>

-> These are the currently available V2.1e Modules. More to come soon~!

=-=-=-=-=-=-About the Project-=-=-=-=-=-=

The original NES Power Module is very noisy.  The Power Traces cross eachother and the ground home path is messy.
EMI was not a worry in 1985 but noise can impact picture and sound quality. Instead, we move forward with the best of modern engineering, with classic hardware.

There have been many improvements over time with even safety features being added to allow extra tolerance in the design for faults.
We continue to think of collaborative designs and improvements for all our projects. Please stay tuned!

# Goals with these new NES Power Modules
- Full Ground Plane that is uninterrupted and is free of traces and components.
- Power Traces that do not cross and have the GND plane below for a good return power signal.
- Have a specific NES Power Module for each use case (not try and pile everything into one board)
- Keeping units in stock, allowing for repairs to exist in 2023. Many success stories so far to share, and hopefully more to come.
- Updated installation instructions, including Part Assembly Content from the Manufacturer

# More information and resources can be found here:
Version 2.1d is currently being offered in RCA Composite only as of now.

Still sourcing parts for the RGB Modules, and further revisions.

Please stay tuned~!

> "The Original Goals of these boards were to reduce noise.  But by adding a switching regulator, we just added noise back into the boards.  Wanting to return to the roots and use a Linear Regulator like the original NES means we will have far less noise and also Reliablity from a component that has been around for 50 years.  Redesigns were made to best utilize the board layout and special care was taken to get the Linear Regulator in the same spot as the original so the original Heat Shield can be used." -Merlin Shaw 2023

More information on compatible parts, and alternative modules will be provided. As more changes are made.

# Below is an example of the Orignal Power Module, Notice how the power traces keep crossing eachother and other components. Folks really didn't consider EMI a lot back then and opted to just cover the entire board in a metal shroud.
